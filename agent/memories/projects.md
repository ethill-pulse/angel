## Phase Details

### P1.1 Scale — HT Spot Automation (RED)
Full STP: Talos → Pulse → BK → BitGo + Customers Bank recon.
- **Two BTC/USD trades flowed in production March 27 — fully automated, no human intervention**
- Company-wide demo targeting **April 18** for BitGo settlement instruction capability
- SSI wallet storage in prod (code merged), needs prod sign-off — ETA 4/17 for full SSI build
- Bank recon (Cubix) nearly done — ops validating as of Apr 6
- BitGo security VM solution agreed (Shlomi Avivi)
- Trade confirmation build ETA Apr 10
- Recon (Talos↔BK↔BitGo) not yet started — 4 layers defined (see below)
- Stablecoin collateral support: Apr 11 target
- **Known bug**: BK Pset resolving to DTC instead of crypto — hardcode workaround deployed; proper fix is a Pset rule in BK Gate
- **Known issue**: CSDGCT company code (Clear Street Digital CT) not recognized in BK — fell back to CSLLC for testing
- **Concern**: BK leadership spreading thin; BitGo batch settlement only twice/day (not real-time)

**4 reconciliation layers (defined, not yet built):**
1. Talos ↔ BK (front/back office)
2. BK ↔ BitGo (real-time + EOD snapshot)
3. Pulse ↔ Exchanges (independent execution verification)
4. BK ↔ Haruko (EOD; BK is source of truth)

### P1.3 — LT RFQ to LP (GREEN)
Polaris doing RFQ/RFS to RenGen as LP. Talos for post-trade. Testing starts 4/3.

### P1.4 — LT Front-to-Back (GREEN)
Digital Trade Engine routing RFQ to RenGen → Studio EMS + Active Trader. Apr 30.

### P2.1 — Crypto Swap (Complete)
Voyager + Athena upgraded for digital assets. BK→Athena integration complete. CFTC de minimis threshold tracking built.

### P2.3 — CFTC Swap Dealer Application (AMBER)
Working with Potomac + PWC. ~40% of control gaps in progress, 60% not started. Application target Jun 30 (6-9 month approval timeline). Risk hiring just started.

### P2.5 — OTC Options (AMBER)
Manual flow and requirements captured. Deribit for pricing data (Eric owns eng). Haruko for risk. Limited eng capacity until P1.1 scale and basics close out.

### P4 — Loan & Borrow / Haruko (GREEN)
First loan booked 3/27. Haruko prod instance up: hcad-cls1.prod.haruko.io
**Hackathon offsite week of April 13** — Neil (Haruko, NY) + Rasmus (SecFin, CS) attending.
Goals: 4 recon layers, loan management E2E, spot trades visible in Haruko. Options + PMS P&L out of scope.
- CLST→Haruko: Talos→BK→Haruko data flow (spot + loans) — In Progress (Kevin Stevens / Chris Davidson)
- Haruko→Olympus→BK (loan/borrow): In Progress (Wojciech Baj / Rasmus)
- **Risk bypassed** for initial integration — Atul's decision; Risk team (Ricky, Yang) not at offsite despite live trading
- Loan structure: bilateral B2B MLA (not repo — avoids MTL requirement); BitGo as custodian; ~7–7.5% cash borrow rate; CS can rehypothecate BTC collateral
- 5 margin systems currently issuing calls simultaneously: Olympus, Bezos, Wrench, Voyager, Haruko

### P5 — Payments
- Inbound (Cubix/Customers Bank): GREEN, Nostro recon in ops validation
- Outbound: AMBER — flow agreed, Kyriba may not be needed; Studio approval workflow being built. Alignment meeting 4/7.
